# Guide to Running
1) Setup the workspace in eclipse
2) Run the BulletinBoardServer.java in eclipse (still required for the JDBC driver to work)
3) If it is not setup by default, right-click on the project: Properties > Java Build Path > Add External JARs > select "lib/sqlite-jdbc-3.40.0.0.jar" > Apply & Close
4)  Running BulletinBoardServer.java again should work now
5) Open a terminal and navigate the "../src" then run BulletinBoardClient.java
6) They should now be properly setup
